# Notes
I am a Make School Summer Academy student learning Swift and iOS App Development :)

This Notes app is a clone of the default Apple Notes application, which allows users to add notes (with their respective titles) and view a scrollable list of them as well as their full details. 

Main Concepts Learned:
- Working with the Stack View (Horizontal & Vertical)
- Auto Layout
- Working with Table Views, View Controllers, and Table Cells of different types
- Basic UI design through Storyboards
- Navigation Controllers
- Segues (transitions between screens of the app)
- Navigation Bar Buttons (Save, Cancel, etc.)
- Models to represent data (in this case, notes)
- Basic Realm (persistent data storage)
